# Scripts overview

Purpose
This folder contains support scripts and SQL used for validation and tooling.

Where to look
- Requirements and acceptance criteria live in docs/requirements.md
- Validation logic lives in scripts/bq_validation.sql
- Project overview lives in README.md

Notes
- scripts/bq_validation.sql is the single source of truth for BigQuery validation queries
- Use scripts/README.md only as a pointer to authoritative sources, not as a rule book
